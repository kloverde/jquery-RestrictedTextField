Source code contributions to this project are welcome.  To increase the likelihood of your code being accepted,
please follow these few rules:

1.  Before beginning work on adding features, contact me at the e-mail address listed on my GitHub profile and
    tell me what you'd like to do.  This will spare you from wasting time and effort if I disagree about the
    appropriateness of your proposed change.

2.  Maintain the existing code formatting practices.

3.  Use three spaces for indentation.  DO NOT USE TABS FOR INDENTATION.  In fact, don't use tabs for any kind
    of whitespace.  This is so important that it gets its own rule, rather than being implicitly stated by
    Rule #2.

4.  Include thorough, complete test coverage of your changes in SeleniumTester.  If you don't include complete
    test coverage, your changes will not be accepted.  If your changes are of a nature that no new tests are
    necessary (for example, you're tweaking an existing regular expression which already has test coverage and
    was failing in an obscure browser), include a note which mentions this.  This will ensure that your
    changes are not automatically rejected.

5.  Submit your changes through pull requests on GitHub.  Code submissions sent by other means won't be
    accepted.
